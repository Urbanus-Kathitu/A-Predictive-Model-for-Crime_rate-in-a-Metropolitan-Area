# A-Predictive-Model-for-Crime_rate-in-a-Metropolitan-Area
My First Machine Learning Model
I have been hired as a Data Scientist/Analyst by the Central Police Oï¬ƒce of Metropolitan areas, and my job is now to create a predictive model for crime_rate. 
Assume the data has already undergone EDA and the dataset is balanced.
A few of the requirements I will need to perform are : 
Loading the necessary libraries
Loading the Data
Performing Freature Selection
Splitting the data
Creating the Model
Visualising A Decision Tree
