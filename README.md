# A-Predictive-Model-for-Crime_rate-in-a-Metropolitan-Area
My First Machine Learning Model
I have been hired as a Data Scientist/Analyst by the Central Police Oï¬ƒce of Metropolitan areas, and my job is now to create a predictive model for crime_rate. 
Assume the data has already undergone EDA and the dataset is balanced.
A few of the requirements I will need to perform are :

a) Loading the necessary libraries
b) Loading the Data
c) Performing Freature Selection
d) Splitting the data
e) Creating the Model
f) Visualising A Decision Tree
