# A-Predictive-Model-for-Crime_rate-in-a-Metropolitan-Area
My First Machine Learning Model
I have been hired as a Data Scientist/Analyst by the Central Police Oï¬ƒce of Metropolitan areas, and my job was to create a predictive model to predict the crime rate in the Area. 

Firstly I started by choosing the fitting column in my dataset which would be my Dependant variable which was (crime_rate)
Afterwards I selected a few fitting colums I felt played a vital role in influencing the crime rate as my Independat variables.

Assume the data has already undergone EDA and the dataset is balanced.
A few of the requirements I will need to perform are :

a) Loading the necessary libraries

b) Loading the Data

c) Performing Freature Selection

d) Splitting the data

e) Creating the Model

f) Visualising A Decision Tree
